      <h3>Swinomish Youth Center</h3>
      <p>An extensive addition and remodel project to the existing building
      upgraded classroom, office, and meeting spaces. The existing gym which houses
      sport and other Tribal functions was upgraded to improve acoustics, natural
      lighting and fire protection. As always we self-performed the civil, concrete
      and carpentry work.
      <br />
      <br />
      Our history with the Community also includes several projects on the Tribal
      Center. The most recent involved extensive repairs after a major roof failure.
      Demolition and drying work grew into a complete remodel and Code upgrade that
      respected the history and significance of the building. We've been fortunate
      to work on these projects with the excellent Community facilities teams along
      with architectural and trade experts.</p>

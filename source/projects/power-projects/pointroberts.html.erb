      <h3>Point Roberts Substation</h3>
      <p> Point Roberts was an existing 25kV to 12.5kV substation fed from BC Hydroâ€™s distribution system.  We served as civil and concrete subcontractor to Potelco, Inc. to rebuild the station as a double bank station with an open air feeder structure just south of the existing site.  The work included demolition, grading, imported fill, concrete foundations, chain link fencing, landscaping and yard surfacing.  We self-performed all work except fencing and landscaping.
      <br />
      <br />
      Point Roberts is part of Washington State but not physically connected to the
      mainland U.S. Driving there requires border crossings through British
      Columbia, Canada - complicating travel and material deliveries. A challenge
      arose when a container filled with common landscaping plants was turned back
      at the border. The creative solution was to barge the materials across
      Boundary Bay from Anacortes, WA.</p>
